What is O(1) complexity?,Constant — runtime doesn’t depend on input size. Example: Accessing an element in an array by index (arr[5])
What is O(log n) complexity?,Logarithmic — runtime grows proportionally to the logarithm of the input size. Example: Binary search.
What is O(n) complexity?,Linear —  runtime grows proportionally to the input size. Example: Traversing a list.
What is O(n log n) complexity?,"Quasilinear — runtime grows proportionally to n times the logarithm of n. Example: Merge sort, heap sort."
What is O(n^2) complexity?,"Quadratic — runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size. Example: Nested loops, bubble sort."
What is O(2^n) complexity?,"Exponential — runtime doubles with each additional input. Example: Tower of Hanoi, generating all subsets of a set."
What is O(n!) complexity?,Factorial — runtime grows factorially with the input size. Example: Permutations of a string.
Rank the complexities from fastest to slowest.,O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!).
