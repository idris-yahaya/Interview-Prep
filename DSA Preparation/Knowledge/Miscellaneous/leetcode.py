""" Coding Workflow """

# 1. Understand (5 mins)
#  - Rephrase the problem to confirm understanding
#  - Clarify constraints, assumptions, and edge cases
#  - Define input and output specifications and formats
#  - Validate understanding with a simplified example

# 2. Strategize (5 mins)
#  - Discuss potential approaches (trade-offs, complexities)
#  - Agree on the best approach; outline steps and optimize

# 3. Implement (15 mins)
#  - Write clean, modular code while explaining your reasoning
#  - Utilize meaningful comments, variables, and function names
#  - Request permission for shortcuts or stubbing trivial functions

# 4. Review (5 mins)
#  - Scan for errors and identify potential refactoring
#  - Test with edge cases and the provided examples
#  - Reiterate complexities and suggest improvements
